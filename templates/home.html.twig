<p>
    This is a tool for running Wikisouce proofreading contests
    (especially the annual <em>Wikisource Anniversary Proofreading Contest</em>, WAPC).
</p>

<p>
    During a contest people can help <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Help:Proofread">proofread</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Help:Beginner%27s_guide_to_validation">validate</a> book pages on Wikisouces.
    For each page either proofread or validated the participant gain points.
    At the end of the contest, a prize is awarded to the Wikisourceror with the most points.
    Second and third-place prize are awarded with a random drawing from all the remaining contestants:
    each point that you gained during the contest is like a lottery ticket,
    so the more points you have gained during the contest (that is, the more pages you have proofread or validated),
    the more chances you have to win.
</p>

<p>
    There are three components to the score:
    1) the total <em>Points</em>;
    2) the total number of <em>Validations</em> performed; and
    3) the total number of constructive <em>Contributions</em> of all sorts.
